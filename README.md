# Word-Processor


This mini project has functions such as : open file ,save file , save new file , cut function (ctrl +
x ) , copy ( ctrl + c ), paste( ctrl + v ), insert picture. I have also added some functions that
are able to change the font style and font size such as bold , italic , underline , strike
through.
